# CubeastAnalyzer

CubeastAnalyzer is a tool designed to analyze and visualize data related to cube solving. It provides various statistical functions and visualizations to help users understand their performance and improve their solving skills.

## Features

- **Average Time**: Displays the running average time of solves.
- **Average Recognition and Execution**: Shows the running average split by recognition and execution times.
- **Count of Solves by Time**: Visualizes the number of solves within specific time ranges.
- **Average Turns Per Second (TPS)**: Displays the average TPS and TPS during execution.
- **Average Turns**: Shows the average number of turns per solve.
- **Top Fastest Solves**: Lists the top fastest solves.
- **Average Standard Deviation**: Displays the running standard deviation of solve times.
- **Percentage of Solves by Cross Color**: Shows the percentage of solves starting with each cross color.
- **Solve Time by Inspection Time**: Visualizes the average solve time grouped by inspection time.
- **Average Time by Step**: Displays the average time taken for each step of the solve.
- **Average Inspection Time**: Shows the running average inspection time.
- **OLL Edge Orientation**: Displays the percentage of OLL cases by edge orientation.
- **PLL Corner Permutation**: Shows the percentage of PLL cases by corner permutation.
- **Time Per Step Compared to Typical Solver**: Compares the user's step times to those of a typical solver.
- **Percentage of Good and Bad Solves**: Displays the percentage of solves considered good or bad based on user-defined criteria.
- **History of Records**: Shows the history of personal bests (PBs) for single, Ao5, and Ao12.
